# FinancialReacts DEPRECATED 
A financial bundler that reads pdfs with financial transactions and parses the data into readable graphs, summaries and charts for viewing trends. Potential build on: predictions based on various modeling structures.

### Research

After a bit of reading into package.json, the scripts section can run bash files along with raw bash code. I think I will create a bash script that runs the python script with a file path to the pdf I have from WF. More research is needed but I believe I should start with this to programmatically run scripts using npm:

*npm install npm*




Some personal dev notes:

git commit -am [MESSAGE]

npm run *  <- name of script in package.json
